# Customer Behavior and Predicting Churn

## Scenario
You work as a data analytics engineer for a Ritz Jager Bank, analyzing customer behavior and predicting churn. The dataset provides information on existing credit card customers, including demographic data, financial behavior, and interaction history. Your goal is to build a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn (Attrition_Flag = "Attrited Customer") based on their attributes and behavior. This model will help the bank retain valuable customers and reduce customer churn.
